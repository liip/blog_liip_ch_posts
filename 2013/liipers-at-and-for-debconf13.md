Over the two last weeks, both Kevin and myself have had the great pleasure to help organizing the 14th [Debian](http://debian.org/) Conference, [DebConf13](http://debconf13.ch/ "DebConf13.ch"), which was held in Switzerland, at [Le Camp](http://www.lecamp.ch/), in Vaumarcus, on the shore of Lake Neuch√¢tel.

### Organisation
Organizing a full week of talks for more than 300 attendees from all over the world has been quite a challenge for the so-called _DebConf-Team_:

- convincing that both the expensive Switzerland and the unusual conference venue were suitable for hosting the annual conference of the project;
- finding enough sponsors in all contribution categories to make the conference financially viable;
- negotiating and coordinating all big and small logistical concerns (as well as food, accommodation and camping) with the [Le Camp](http://www.lecamp.ch/) staff;
- scheduling more than 120 events on the six possible days in four rooms, across eleven tracks;
- setting up two parallel wireless networks for more than 500 unique devices;
- setting up and operating the video-streaming infrastructure for the two main talk rooms live for the benefit of remote attendees;
- coordinating the accommodation of more than 200 attendees on-site;
- given the remoteness of the venue, organizing a bar for the hallway track and evening chats (with [good Swiss beer](http://www.haslibier.ch/)!);
- enabling a work atmosphere for the benefit of all attendees;
- organizing 6 parallel DayTrip programs while still bringing everyone together;
- organizing the 20th birthday of the [Debian project](http://debian.org/);

### Talks and hacking
While the [social](https://gallery.debconf.org/main.php?g2_itemId=59936), [outside](http://photos.cihar.com/g/2013-debconf/IMGP8487.html) and [leisure](http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/swiss_cheese/) activities have certainly been the most enjoyable part of this DebConf, noone forgot the main [goals of DebConf](http://debconf.org/goals.shtml): face-to-face interactions, talks and work.

As mentioned above, [DebConf13](http://debconf13.ch/) permitted more than 120 events to happen, split between formal stand-up talks, BoF ([Birds of Feather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)), structured work-sessions) and Debian team meetings.
If any of the [topics](http://penta.debconf.org/dc13_schedule/events.en.html) raises some interest to you, you can find all the [DebConf13 videos](http://www.irill.org/videos/debconf13/) online, thanks to the amazing work of the DebConf video team.

In a more personal level, I have had the pleasure and opportunity to present one talk titled [From Smaky to Colobot, a history of software in Switzerland](http://penta.debconf.org/dc13_schedule/events/1011.en.html), in the [DebConf 20th birthday track](http://debconf13.debconf.org/birthday.xhtml).
### Liip
This wouldn't have been possible without the support of Liip in two contexts:

- Liip has agreed to become a [DebConf13 Bronze sponsor](http://debconf13.debconf.org/sponsors.xhtml#cat3-sponsors). All contributions helped making DebConf13 a possibility, from an idea to the two weeks of awesome reality that it's been.
- Liip allowed both Kevin and myself to attend the conference on company time through using our [Further Education](http://www.liip.ch/en/who/philosophy#LEARNING) budgets, made of both time and money (in this case, for attendance fees).

Many thanks to Liip!

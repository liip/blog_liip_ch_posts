The past weekend held the third [European PHP Unconference](http://www.phpuceu.org/) in Palma de Mallorca.
Four Liipers attended: Adrian Philipp, Fabian Schweizer, Dorian Villet and Mikkel HÃ¸gh.

We had a great weekend in the company of other PHP developers and enthusiasts from all across Europe. As an unconference, the focus was not as much on presenting already known solutions, but rather on encouraging discussion and growth of new ideas and common understandings. The topics were many and diverse, and the surroundings were great for socialising and after-hours discussions, so among the other things we learned was the location of one of the best tapas bars imaginable.

As it has already been announced, that the event will also be on Mallorca next year, we can say: we'll be back.

## A New Post

We did a small two person hackday to get to know Cassandra a bit. Lukas already learned a bit about Cassandra at [Berlin Buzzwords](http://blog.liip.ch/archive/2014/06/03/berlin-buzzwords-2014.html) but it was time to get some hands on experience to better understand how Cassandra would work out in a real client project. Our agenda for the day was however essentially: get it to run, see how to get it connected with PHP and then import some data and do some queries. But first a very brief summary of what Cassandra is about:

* Decentralization based on Dynamo paper    
* Datastorage based on Googles Bigtable paper
* Some good presentations: 
 - http://www.slideshare.net/davegardnerisme/cassandras-sweet-spot-an-introduction-to-apache-cassandra 
 - https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/2489-cassandra

To get up and running we tried different approaches. One was just to [download one of the VMs](http://planetcassandra.org/try-cassandra/) provided by DataStax (the main company driving Cassandra). That sort of works but the VM operating system is not really nicely configured. But it was at least enough to run a first few [queries we found in the Cassandra wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted).

Now we wanted to install the PDO driver for Cassandra. So we setup a new VM and [installed Thrift and Cassandra](http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cassandra/2.0/cassandra/install/installDeb_t.html?).. Installing

Pros and cons
-------------

+ Write speed
+ High availability due to decentralisation, no master node 
+ Linearly scalable without downtime
+ Consistency highly controllable, use when needed
+ Ad-hoc queries possible via SQL-ish language (*)
- Index supported queries need to be planned in advance, may require denormalization to support different index supported queries in the same data-set
- Not all queries possible (very limited aggregation capabilities), so in practice other systems might need to be attached for searching
